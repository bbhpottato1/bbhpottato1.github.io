                Hello, My name is bbhpottato14, and i am a musical
                creator from Harrison, NJ. I have photography as a side project
                that i have been working on. This website hopes to share this
                pasion for music and photography with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started making music around January of 2024,
                was inspired by my good friend EG. Another
                musical creator from Harrison. He taught me everthing
                that i know about music. I am currently working on an
                album set to release on June 14, 2024. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I started to get into photography in early December
                with the release of a self recorded documentary titled
                Beyond Skin: Comfronting Racism. This sparked my love
                for cinematography and photography. Then around the end
                of Feburary, I ordered a Nikon F65 Vintage film slr.
                This fully got me into photography and helped me build
                my confidence with cameras. My first roll of film that
                I shot on my camera did give me some trouble; I had run
                into a problem while loading film into the camera. Due to
                the cameras automatic nature, It was alot harder to load
                the film without making a mistake. So the first roll snapped
                at the end of the roll. This left me devistated knowing that
                the roll of film that i spent 2 days shooting was now garbage.
                but i didn't give up and I bought another roll.
