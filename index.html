                Hello, My name is bbhpottato14, and i am a musical <br>
                creator from Harrison, NJ. I have photography as a side project <br>
                that i have been working on. This website hopes to share this <br>
                pasion for music and photography with others. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                I started making music around January of 2024, <br>
                was inspired by my good friend EG. Another <br>
                musical creator from Harrison. He taught me everthing <br>
                that i know about music. I am currently working on an <br>
                album set to release on June 14, 2024. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                I started to get into photography in early December <br>
                with the release of a self recorded documentary titled <br>
                Beyond Skin: Comfronting Racism. This sparked my love <br>
                for cinematography and photography. Then around the end <br>
                of Feburary, I ordered a Nikon F65 Vintage film slr. <br>
                This fully got me into photography and helped me build <br>
                my confidence with cameras. My first roll of film that <br>
                I shot on my camera did give me some trouble; I had run <br>
                into a problem while loading film into the camera. Due to <br>
                the cameras automatic nature, It was alot harder to load <br>
                the film without making a mistake. So the first roll snapped <br>
                at the end of the roll. This left me devistated knowing that <br>
                the roll of film that i spent 2 days shooting was now garbage. <br>
                but i didn't give up and I bought another roll. <br>
